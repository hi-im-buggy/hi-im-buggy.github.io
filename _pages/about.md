I'm a student researcher at [IIIT Hyderabad](https://iiit.ac.in), advised by [Vinoo Alluri](https://www.iiit.ac.in/faculty/vinoo-alluri/)
and [Makarand Tapaswi](https://makarandtapaswi.github.io/), currently working on my Master's thesis.

My research is primarily concerned with how deep neural networks process and organize information for auditory tasks.
I'm also interested in interpretability and auditory processing at large, multi-modal deep learning in vision-language
and audio-language models.
